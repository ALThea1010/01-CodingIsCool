This code is a simple little exercise that shows how to work with words in Python.

Storing Words: First, it creates three variables word1, word2, and word3 to hold individual words:

word1 is set to "Coding".
word2 is set to "is".
word3 is set to "Cool".
combining It Together: Next, it uses the print function to stitch these words into a full sentence. It adds spaces between the words by including (" " or qoutation marks) in the mix, so they don't just squish together.

What You See: When you run this code, it pops up the message "Coding is Cool" on your screen.
